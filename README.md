# GoGetYourKeys
Final Project for SAT3812

## log.py
This is the keylogger that will be installed on to the victim's computer. The executable is located in the build/directory. For demonstration purposes, we were only able to auto install the python script which cannot be autorun. However, if hosted on a server, the executable could be downloaded.

## setup.py
This is the script that is used to build the executable for log.py. It uses the cx_Freeze python library. We used a script provided by J Maria Irudaya Regila.
